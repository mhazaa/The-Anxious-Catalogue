  <p>I asked 50 people how anxiety feels to them, and what gives them release</p>

<div id="happyThoughts">

    <p class="happyThought">
      Video games are really great, like Stardew Valley
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Showers, video games, drawing
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I&#39;ll listen to instrumental music- Stoick&#39;s Ship, ALice in wonderland theme, all Spirit Stallion of the Cimmaron sound track and doodle pictures
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      i put on glitter makeup and let myself wear the socks i like, i read/listen/watch to fics podcasts videos
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Sex
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Writing
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Play games, or watch youtube.
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I try to take a minute and give myself a break by either watching videos, playing video games, or doing a different assignment that&#39;s less stressful
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Pray
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Blow stuff up in video games
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Honestly, I just work on solving whatever problem stresses me out. I hate not being able to fix my problems more than anything
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Hang out with people!
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">

    <p class="happyThought">
      Talk to my mom
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      If my anxiety gets to the point of a panic attack, I smoke weed to force myself to calm down. My panic attacks put me out of commission for an entire day, sometimes two, but when I smoke it calms me down within a few hours, and I can still have a productive day.
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Organize myself by scheduling and executing my plans. Actively solving my problem helps keep me calm, which leads to overworking.
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I find comfort in listening to my peers venting, it reminds me that we all have issues (big or small) and that we just need to do our best and support each other
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Tea, knitting, breath work, snuggling, warm delicious meal, watch my little pony rainbow rocks or tangled to have a good cry and cheer yp. Aggretsuko is is a great cheery cartoon too. And Steven Universe. Held by a friend or a partner while i cry or tell them about the fears and anxieties
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I like to play games
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I like to talk to my close friends. Sometimes voicing my issues and trying to plan a schedule helps. I also like taking 2 or so hours to take care of myself. (Like showering, shaving, brushing and washing my hair, putting on clean clothes.)
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I guess gaming in it&#39;s own way is therapeutic
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      Get near friends for distractions or close people for physical contact like hugs
    </p>

      draw, write, scream, anything to get it out
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I blast music! I love music with fun rhythms. Because I&#39;m super jittery and have a need to just /move,/ finding music that I unconsciously bob my head to is awesome. It redirects anxious energy away from the need to scratch at myself or wring my hands or whatever, and I can sing along!
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I just let everything out, whether it be crying or venting to a friend about what im stressed about
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I love to draw, play my violin, and listen to music. All of those things seem just kind of freestyle to me, and I usually just can relax when I do those things
    </p>

      sometimes i let myself daydream (cutesy + domestic life stuff about/involving said closest friend), other times i draw my ocs or canon characters from my fave shows, sometimes i&#39;ll watch anime
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I try new things either arts and crafts (sewing, doll sculpting, yarn things ect.ect.) or cooking and baking because making food is very familiar and comforting since i have been cooking since i was 4 (first two things i made were caramelized onions and scrambled eggs xD )
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">
      I try and see my boyfriend, who is very supportive of me and keeps my trichotillomania from acting up

    <p class="happyThought">
      Cry eventually
    </p>

    <p class="happyThought">

      I practice mindfulness

    </p>

    <p class="anxiousThought">
      Anxiety makes me feel jittery and so out-of-control. It makes me feel powerless, and I hate talking about it. Especially with my dad; in our household, &#39;everything is a choice.&#39; So if I&#39;m freaking out and take a nap because I tire myself out, that was a choice of mine, and thus, my dads allowed to be angry about it
    </p>

    <p class="anxiousThought">
      it makes me antsy and irritable, super sensitive

    </p>

    <p class="anxiousThought">
      Instant stress. It gets my heart going like i had been running. It makes me say things i don&#39;t want to and be very short when there is no reason to be (im rude for no reason or i just say things out of order). It also make me feel guilty even if i did nothing wrong. As though everyone around me is staring at me or making comments about me
    </p>

    <p class="anxiousThought">
      My heart feels like its being crushed or squeezed, and my entire body heats up. I begin to sweat. It can also cause my trichotillomania to act up, resulting in hair loss from my eyelashes and eyebrows
